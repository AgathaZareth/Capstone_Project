    "# Introduction\n",
    "Intuitively, it makes sense that the performance of the team as a whole is more important than individual players themselves. We are all familiar with the idiom \"greater than the sum of its parts\" and baseball teams are no exception. This notebook will provide an understanding of how a teams cumulative statistics influence the percentage of wins in their regular season games. With this inferentail understanding there is also predictive capabilities, that is to say, the be able to take in the statistics of a team, then to *predict* that teams win percentage for their regular season. The effectiveness of this predictive model will be measured by how well it predicts win percentages in a test set; a set that I have the answers for but the model does not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The insight provided by the inferential aspects will guide my recruitment recommendations and the predictive ability will test the new rosters potential win percentage. "

This year SF Giants General Manager (Pete Putila), SF Giants Senior Director of Player Development (Kyle Haines), and Senior Director of Amatuer Scouting (Micheal Holmes) are looking to invest a huge portion of their efforts into recruiting from college and minor league levels. Beyond looking at an individual player's potential, they want predictions on the collective cohesiveness of a team and how the team as a whole will perform throughout the season. The most obvious metric to evaluate this is a teams percentage of wins during a regular season. </p>"

    "## Sourcing Data\n",
    "I have sourced all my own data and did not use any premade datasets. \n",
    "All the data collected came from web scraping of various websites. Each set needed quite a bit of code to acquire, and then clean, so this resulted in several notebooks. To better understand my process I have a brief overview of what each notebook contains, below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Scraping Player Stats\n",
    " - **Division I Collegiate Player Stats**  can be found in the [College_table notebook](https://github.com/AgathaZareth/Capstone_Project/blob/main/notebooks/College_table.ipynb). Here I got a list of Division I colleges from [TheBaseballCube.com](https://thebaseballcube.com). Then using this list I was able to select only division 1 college slugs from [D1Baseball.com](https://d1baseball.com). From there I was able to scrap players hitting stats for 2022 from each division 1 college. \n",
    "\n",
    " - **Triple-A Minor League Player Stats** can be found in the [MiLB_table notebook](https://github.com/AgathaZareth/Capstone_Project/blob/main/notebooks/MiLB_table.ipynb). From [MiLB.com](https://www.milb.com) I first got a list of team id numbers for the triple A teams, then I used those to change url slugs to get player hitting stats. Fortunately, this website defaults to showing qualified players only so the resulting data frame is much smaller because it is already filtered to just the relevant players. \n",
    "\n",
    " - **MLB Player Stats** can be found in the [MLB_5_seasons notebook](https://github.com/AgathaZareth/Capstone_Project/blob/main/notebooks/MLB_5_seasons.ipynb). From [MLB.com](https://www.mlb.com)  I swapped out years and page numbers in urls to get players hitting stats for 5 seasons. \n",

Next I found the cumulative totals of the players on a team, as well as their averages. Secondly, I used MLB game stats to get teams number of wins and losses for each season, to get the win percentage, per team, per season. Finally, I added the win percentages to the aggregated stats table. \n",

The first 12 features are cumulative totals of team stats and the second 12 are those same stats but divided by the number of players to get the mean. If I use both, the cumulative totals and the averages, there will be a lot of multicollinearity. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with one another, and as you can imagine using one statistic to aquire the other would have a high correlation. So I need to make a choice on which set to use. I will use regplots to show me which features have a 'cleaner' linear relationship with my target variable. This method is used to plot data and a linear regression model fit. There are a number of mutually exclusive options for estimating the regression model see documentation [HERE](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.regplot.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Heatmaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "The regplots show the relationship between the features and target variable. The heatmap will show the  correlations between all of the numeric values (in this case, all the features) in our data. The x and y axis labels indicate the pair of values that are being compared, and the color and the number are both representing the correlation. Color is used here to make it easier to find the largest/smallest numbers. The bottom row is particulary important because it shows all the features correlation with the target variable but I am also looking for strong correlation between the independent variables.
